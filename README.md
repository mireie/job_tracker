# Setup/Installation Requirements

## Intial Project Setup

- Ruby is required, download and install [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- Bundler is required, install using the terminal with `gem install bundler`
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and correctly running on your local machine
- Create a directory to clone the public repository from GitHub using `git clone <https://github.com/mireie/job_tracker`>
- Enter the root of the project directory and install all gems with `bundle install`

## Initializing the Database

- Update the `config/database.yml` file to match your PostgreSQL setup
- Initialize the database with `rake db:create` and initialize tables with `rake db:migrate`
    - If you encounter errors here, your `database.yml` file is likely not set up correctly and you skipped the previous step!
- Seed the database with users and jobs with the terminal command `rake db:seed`

## Running the Application

- To run the site on your local machine in the terminal run `rails s`
- Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` (default configuration)
